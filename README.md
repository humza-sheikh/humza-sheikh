### Builder Since 13.  
### Now Scaling Companies With AI.

---

When I was 13, I started importing Xbox accessories from China and selling them on eBay UK.

No mentors.  
No funding.  
Just curiosity and obsession.

That curiosity turned into a portfolio of digital businesses:
- 🎮 A FIFA coins marketplace
- 📦 A 6-figure Amazon FBA brand
- 👕 Print on demand
- 📚 Kindle publishing
- 🎮 A digital game store on eBay
- 🚀 Core team member at ElectronicFirst — helping scale to 8 figures

Today, I’m **Head of AI at ElectronicFirst**, building systems that replace friction with automation.

And now, I build AI-native companies.
