# I sold Xbox controllers on eBay at 13. Now I build AI companies.

**The gap between those two sentences is the whole story.**

## The Origin Story

It started with a spreadsheet, a PayPal account, and a 13-year-old who refused to wait for an allowance.

I was sourcing Xbox accessories from Chinese manufacturers and selling them on eBay UK before I could drive. That business taught me things no classroom touches: supplier negotiation is a conversation, not a transaction. Margins live in the details. The internet doesn’t care how old you are if you can deliver value.

That was the first chapter. There have been many since.

## The Portfolio Years

What followed was a decade of jumping into markets most people never think to enter:

- **FIFA Coins** - Found a digital economy inside a video game and built a business around it
- **Amazon FBA** - Scaled a physical products brand to six figures, learning logistics, PPC, and the brutal economics of Amazon’s algorithm the hard way
- **Print on Demand** - Zero inventory. Pure creativity and conversion rate optimisation
- **Kindle Publishing** - Content as a product. SEO as a distribution channel
- **Digital Game Store (eBay)** - Back to eBay, but at a completely different scale

Each one was a different discipline: supply chains, digital marketing, content, paid acquisition, marketplace dynamics. Some worked better than others. All of them taught me something.

## ElectronicFirst: Where Scale Gets Serious

Eventually everything pointed in the same direction.

I joined the core team at **ElectronicFirst** and helped take the business from its early stages to an **8-figure revenue operation**. Every system I’d built in scrappy solo environments had to be rethought at this scale - the margins for error shrink, the operational complexity stacks up fast, and the decisions carry real weight.

I’m currently **Head of AI at ElectronicFirst**, responsible for identifying, building, and rolling out AI-driven solutions across the business.

## What I’m Building Now

### [Automization.io](https://automization.io/) - AI-Ready Talent, At Speed

The problem with AI adoption isn’t the technology. It’s the people.

Most businesses are sitting on AI opportunities they can’t ship because they don’t have developers who know how to build with LLMs, agents, and automation pipelines at production quality. Automization fixes that: we embed **AI-ready developers** directly into businesses, with a guarantee of a **minimum 300% increase in project shipping velocity**.

Currently doing **six figures per annum** and growing.

## Where It All Comes From

The 13-year-old selling Xbox accessories didn’t have a strategy deck or a business plan. He just spotted a gap between what something cost and what someone would pay for it, and moved quickly.

That hasn’t changed. The tools are just a lot more interesting now.
